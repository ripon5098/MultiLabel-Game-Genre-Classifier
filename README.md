# MultiLabel-Game-Genre-Classifier

An text classification model from data collection, cleaning, model training, deployment and API integration. <br/>
The model can classify 70 different types of genres of games <br/>
It is a multilabel game genre classifier that takes the description of a game as input and predicts its genres.<br/>
I have scraped data from [this website](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame/page/1).

I deployed the model to HuggingFace Spaces Gradio App. The implementation can be found in `app` folder or [here]()
